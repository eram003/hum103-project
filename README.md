# HUM103 Website – AI, Religion & Ethics

During my Residential Semester at BRAC University, I worked on a HUM103 project where I developed a website for our group's research.

The focus was on the intersection of artificial intelligence, religion, and ethics. It includes case studies on:

- The Israel–Palestine conflict and the impact of AI-generated disinformation  
- The persecution of Uyghur Muslims in China through AI surveillance and data systems  

## Contents

- A homepage introducing the topic  
- Contributor pages with individual ethical analyses  
- Research based on ethical theories including:
  - Deontology  
  - Utilitarianism  
  - Rawls’ Theory of Justice  
  - Feminist Ethics  
  - Confucian Ethics  
  - Socratic Method    

## Notes

This project was completed under a tight deadline during exam week. Despite the time pressure, the site was finished on time with full functionality and structured content.
